GAME HACKS & ANSWER KEYS
Gamehack: 
Debug Mode: During the development process, I frequently incorporate a debug mode option to help with testing and troubleshooting. It can enable different debug features like invincibility, infinite resources, or level skipping, enabling myself to swiftly iterate and spot problems.
Developer Console: This comes with an integrated console that lets me enter commands or codes to change specific game mechanics. These instructions could have advantages like enabling gaming modes and move speed for example.
Cheat codes: This will be answered in the answer key section.

Answer key:
Enhanced abilities: Player can collect temporary speed collectibles where it enhances player speed temporary for 10 seconds making it easier to navigate around the map quickly. 
Instructions and clues: This will be shown in text type or instructions text popping out in the screen, giving you idea where to go and what to avoid.

TROUBLESHOOTINGS
Problems with Collision Detection: When a character or object collides with another, collision detection bugs can happen. Characters may sometimes walk through walls, objects may become trapped, or collisions may not properly register.
Solutions: I adjust the mesh collider, to enhance better ray cast and collision. I also implement debugging features or logging systems that record specifics regarding collisions, such as the objects colliding, their locations, and the outcomes of the collision detection. This can be used to pinpoint instances where collisions improperly register. 
Issues with Game Balance: It can be difficult to balance a game's difficulty, progression, and rewards. Sections that are too simple or too challenging, a progression that feels too sluggish or too rapid, or uneven rewards can all be caused by a lack of balance.
Solutions: I asked people around me to playtest the gameplay. Playtest the game frequently and watch how players interact with the various components. Note their responses, irritations, and recommendations. Make iterative tweaks to the game's complexity, progression, and prizes using this input.
Animation Glitches: Animation glitches can cause characters to behave strangely, move erratically, or get trapped in the wrong animation state. The immersion and realism of the game may suffer because of these bugs.
Solutions: Frequently test the animation transitions. And play test on different area od the terrain.
